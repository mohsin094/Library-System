# Library-System
The system should be developed in Laravel or Codeigniter. It will have an admin panel and a client panel.
Admin Panel:
1. Only the user with admin role can login to admin panel and can perform the following actions:
a. Manage the racks (rack name)
b. Manage the books and add them in their specific racks. (book title, author, published
year)
c. Only 10 books can be added in a rack. An alert should prompt if admin is trying to
add more books.

â–ª See the list of all racks and total books in them. Click on any rack to see the added
book details
2. Books
